# Coin-Detection
First year end of year project, involving image processing on an FPGA

Source code contains all the .c files that were used in catapult to create .v files.
Quartus project folder contains the .qpf file and some of the relevant .v files (others were located in other folders). 
The .sof is the latest compiled version of the design.
Some files in the Quartus project folder may no longer be in use in the project, but have been left so that Quartus does not complain.
Verilog files are included, as the Quartus project originally sourced files from many different folders outside of the main project folder.
